##	👋 About<br>
I started using Python when I was a student to do lab work. At the same time, I became interested in information security, and in my fourth year I got a job as an information security engineer at a company. There I began to combine my "desire to create" with the current market needs for IS products. I like to solve non-standard tasks, thanks to such tasks a lot of new things are discovered. Every day I try to learn something new.
